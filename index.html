          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Hi my name is Ashley Jenell Ruiz and I was born on August 15, 2000 in Fresno California. My favorite things to do are listen to music and sing. I also like to write my own music, and have jam sessions with musicians. I love to hang out with my sister Sonya and I love spending time with my Dad even if it is just for a couple of hours. I would say my family is pretty big. I have two older sisters and two older brothers.</p>
          <p>There is actually a few places that I would love to be at for my dream vacation. But overall, my dream vacation would be going to Europe. I would love to hear everyone’s accents, and see how different and fancy it is over there. But my best friend would HAVE to go with me because instead of telling her about it, we can experience it! It would be awesome. </p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
                <p>One of my long term goals is to be able to network and make good friends. I would like to find the right business partners. To find my business partners, I would have to reach other goals before finding them. I would have to be actually be sure of what I’m good at and show it. Finding my business partners is a long term goal because it won’t be that easy to find the right people for the job especially if I’m not that good with networking. Networking is a short term goal that I’m sure I can reach and get better at.</p>
                <p>Another one of my long term goals would be to have a job that I love. I want to be able to have a job that’s something fun, not just work. If I want a job that I love, I would have to reach other short term goals like graduating high school, and going to college. Because to get a good job that you love, you have to get a good education. So that you know things.</p>
